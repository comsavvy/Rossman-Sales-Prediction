                This report documents our approaches in tackling the problem of predicting sales for chain
stores based on historical data. In particular, we present our solutions to the Rossmann
Store Sales problem from Kaggle. We used several data analysis techniques to understand
the given datasets and chose several machine learning algorithms to predict the sales. We
used the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) approach to find trends in the dataset
and implemented commonly-used machine learning techniques to build several models in
order to make the sales predictions. Full-resolution plots can be found in the submitted .zip
file, which also contains all of our source code written in Python 3.

                  <h3>Dataset</h3>
                  <br>
                  <h4>train.csv</h4>
                  This file contains the training dataset which describes the sales figures for a store on a
particular date. The data fields are described below:
                <ul>
                    <ol>Store: a unique numerical store identifier (1 - 1,115)</ol>
                    <ol>DayOfWeek: the day of week (1 - 7)</ol>
                    <ol>Date: the date, ranging from 2013-01-01 to 2015-07-31</ol>
                    <ol>Sales: the turnover of the specified store on the specified date</ol>
                    <ol>Customers: the number of customers of the specified store on the specified date</ol>
                    <ol>Open: indicates whether the store was open (0 = Closed, 1 = Open)</ol>
                    <ol>Promo: indicates whether the store was running a promotion (0 = No, 1 = Yes)</ol>
                    <ol>StateHoliday: indicates if it was a state holiday (a = Public Holiday, b = Easter
                        holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None)</ol>
                    <ol>SchoolHoliday: indicates if it was a school holiday (0 = No, 1 = Yes)</ol>
                    
                </ul>
                <h3>Number of Records: 1,017,209</h3>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <h4>store.csv</h4>
                  This file contains describes additional information about each of the store. The data fields
are described below:
                <ul>
                    <ol>Store: a unique numerical store identifier (1 - 1,115)</ol>
                    <ol>StoreType: differentiates between the 4 different types of stores (a, b, c, d)</ol>
                    <ol>Assortment: describes the assortment of goods carried by the store (a = Basic, b =Extra, c = Extended)</ol>
                    <ol>CompetitionDistance: the distance (in metres) to the nearest competitor’s store</ol>
                    <ol>CompetitionOpenSinceMonth: the month in which the competition opened</ol>
                    <ol>CompetitionOpenSinceYear: the year in which the competition opened</ol>
                    <ol>Promo2: indicates if a store is participating in a continuing and consecutive promotion(0 = No, 1 = Yes</ol>
                    <ol>Promo2SinceWeek: the week of the year in which the store began participating in 
                    Promo2 (from 1 - 52, presumably, but some weeks are unrepresented in the data)</ol>
                    <ol>Promo2SinceYear: the year in which the store began participating in Promo2 (from 2009 - 2015)</ol>
                    <ol>PromoInterval: describes the consecutive intervals in which Promo2 is activated,
                    giving the months the promotion is renewed (either “Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct”, “Feb, May, Aug, Nov” or “Mar, Jun, Sept, Dec”)<ol>
                </ul>
                <h3>Number of Records: 1,115</h3>

                <br>
                <hr>
                <h4>test.csv</h4>
                <br>
                  The dataset provided within this file is used for testing and evaluating the implemented
learning models. The data fields are the same as train.csv, with the exclusion of
Customers & Sales (Sales to be predicted by the model) and an additional field Id which
represents a (Store, Date) tuple that is used to label predictions for submission to Kaggle.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Preprocessing the Dataset</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
                This involved replacing missing values and correcting for misrepresented data using the
following strategies:

                <ul>
                <ol>1. Ensuring consistent data formats for attributes: For example, the StateHoliday
attribute contains both numerical and string representations of numbers. In order to
make it consistent, all the values were changed to the string representation.
</ol>
            <ol>
            2. Substituting NaN values: NaN values were replaced for the following attributes:
<ul><ol>a. CompetitionOpenSince[X]: If CompetitionOpenSince[X] is missing but
CompetitonDistance is not equal to 0, then ‘1900’ was inserted for
CompetitionOpenSinceYear and ‘01’ for CompetitionOpenSinceMonth.<ol>
<ol>b. CompetitionDistance: If CompetitionOpenSince[X] is NaN (not a number)
CompetitionDistance is set to 0.</ol>
<ol>c. Open: If the DayofWeek attribute was anything except Sunday, then the
missing Open data field will be replaced with ‘1’ (i.e. open).</ol></ul>
            </ol>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>One-Hot Encoding</h4>
                <br>
                As machine learning models tend to look for patterns within data, we performed one-hot
encoding on categorical features such as DayOfWeek, StateHoliday, StoreType and
Assortment as they don’t have an inherent order or numerical significance.

                <br>
                <h4>Other Features</h4>
                <br>
                
                <ul>
                    <ol>a. DayOfMonth, Year, Month, YearMonth & WeekOfYear: The date field was broken
down into these fields to provide a richer insight into date-related sales trends.
</ol>
                <ol>b. AvgSales, AvgCustomers, AvgSalesPerCustomer: Stores the average sales per
day, average no. of customers per day and average sales per customer per day
respectively for each store.
</ol>
                <ol>c. AvgCustStore, AvgCustStoreMonth, AvgCustStoreYear: Stores the average
no. of customers per store (overall), per store for a particular month and per store for
a particular year respectively.
</ol>
                <ol>d. StateHolidayBinary: In addition to categorizing StateHoliday by type, an
additional column was added to simply indicate whether it was a state holiday or not.
</ol>
                </ul>
